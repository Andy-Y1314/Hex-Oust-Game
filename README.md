# Non-capturing Placement rules

A **Non-Capturing Placement** is a move that follows these rules:

- ‚úÖ The hexagon you mark is **not adjacent** to any other hexagon (completely isolated), **OR**
- ‚úÖ The hexagon you mark is adjacent **only to opponent's hexagon**
- ‚ùå The hexagon **must not** be adjacent to **any hexagon of the same color**.

**In short:**  
üî¥ **A Non-Capturing Placement does _not_ form any connection with hexagons of your colour.**





# Capturing Placement Rules

A **Capturing Placement** is a move where you **connect your hexagons to your existing group** and potentially **capture opponent hexagons**.

To make a **valid Capturing Placement**, **all** of the following conditions **must be true**:

- ‚úÖ The placed hexagon **connects to one or more of your own groups**.
- ‚úÖ The new, merged group (after placement) **connects to one or more opponent groups**.
- ‚úÖ **Each connected opponent group is smaller** than your new, merged group.

 In the above picture once the red player makes a CP, where they connect with the single red hexagon, the blue player gets eliminated

### Result of a Valid Capturing Placement

- All **connected opponent groups are removed** from the board.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- You **cannot** capture if your new group is **equal to or smaller** than any connected opponent group.
- You **must** form a connection with both:
  - Your own group(s)
  - At least one opponent group
